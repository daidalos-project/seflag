Data, Limitations, and Recommendations

• **Data selection for training**:

• **Data selection for evaluation**: The evaluation in the paper
compares precision, recall and F1 score for two tested models as well as
a qualitative evaluation of the results

• **Limitations**: The model is limited due to scarcity of training data
and the training data not being representative of the whole Ancient
Greek corpus.
